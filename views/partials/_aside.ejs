      The prosperity of our glorious colony depends on clear communication. As a
      faithful member of the swarm, heed these instructions and follow the
      pheromone trail!
    </p>
    <ul class="rules-list">
      <li>
        <em>Born to Serve:</em> You’ve emerged into the colony as an ant — with
        a name, a role, and a duty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>The Cycle of Life:</em> Your identity is bound to this tab. When it
        closes, you fade — as all ants do.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Collective Memory:</em> While individual ants perish, the colony
        remembers. Your messages are its legacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Pheromone Protocol:</em> Stay in character. Think like an ant. Speak
        like an ant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Share Discoveries:</em> Use the Release Pheromone button to
        broadcast food sightings, alerts, or existential dread to your fellow
        ants.
